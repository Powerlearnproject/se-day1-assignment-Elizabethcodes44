#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering involves the application of engineering principles , methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It consısts of software product design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance . Software engineering is very important in the technology industry as it plays an ımportant roles ın dıfferent sectors of technology thereby makşing life easier for people across the globe. It powers varıous aspe ts of modern lıfe in different aspects such as health, agriculture, e-commerce, transportation, communication etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The three key milestones in the evolution of software includes 
1. Evolution of programming languages such as Fortran and C . C has become the foundatıon for modern programming langauges such as Csharp , Javascript , Python e.t.c. This Evolution has brought about helping many people learn and apply modern programming languages easily and efficiently.
2. The advent of structured programming in 1970s
3. The rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

   

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design: This is usually done by a product designer and it involves creating high level designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: Involves writing code and building the software according to the design specification
Testing: Involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requırements. This is usually done by a Quality Assurance Tester
Deployment: Involves releasing the software to users or customers. Thiscan be done with the cloud or other software applications lıke Netlify, vERCEL ETC

Maintenance: Involves providing ongoing support , updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology: Sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements, design, implementation . Flowing downwards like a waterfall. This would be appropriate when the project has clear, fixed requirements from the outset, and these are not expected to change.
While
Agile Methodology : Involves an Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility , collaboration and responding to changes. This would be appropriate when the project requires close collaboration between the development team and stakeholders throughout the development process.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The roles of a software developer is to implement the software by writing codes and adhering to the specifications of the Design.
The roles of a software engineer is to test software solutions for scalability, flexibility etc. This can be done manually or with automations.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES are very important in software development. They are software tools that helps develops to write , debug and test codes e.g Visual Studio Code.
VCS are software tools that tracks changes in source code and coordinate works among team members e.g git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced by software engineers includes but not limited to :
1. Changing software requirements
2. Tight deadlines
3. Technical debts
These can be overcomed with effective communication, agile methodologies, task prioritization etc.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: This involves testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing: This involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing: This involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: This involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Testing: 
Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting the right questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering makes the questions or staements clear and specific so the AI models understands exactly what is needed. ıt helpe to improve the interactions between AI and humans

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:  How can I get a job as a software developer?
Improved Prompt:  I am a software developer with specialization in Python for backend and react with Javascript for the front end. I also use sql for my database and very good with redux . How can I get a job?
The ımproved prompt is more effective due to beıng specific . Now the AI model knows the data to provide that are dırectly related to the software developers background.
